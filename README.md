# Projet-7-Impl-menter-un-mod-le-de-scoring
The company "Prêt à dipenser" wants to implement a “credit scoring” tool to calculate the probability that a customer will repay their credit, then classify the request as granted or refused credit. She therefore wishes to develop a classification algorithm based on various data sources (behavioral data, data from other financial institutions, etc.).

In addition, customer relationship managers have reported that customers are increasingly demanding transparency in credit granting decisions. This customer demand for transparency is completely in line with the values ​​that the company wants to embody.

Ready to spend therefore decides to develop an interactive dashboard so that customer relationship managers can both explain credit granting decisions as transparently as possible, but also allow their customers to access their personal information and explore them easily.
